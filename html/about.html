                <p>
                    I have a passion for computers and have recently started
                    doing a lot of programming. I am proficient in Go and have
                    some experience with JavaScript. I aspire to learn a variety
                    of programming languages, including Zig, Gleam, Odin, C,
                    C++, Dart, Haskell and Assembly. I shared a few of my
                    projects on
                    <a href="https://github.com/AQMpolyface/">my GitHub</a>.

                <p>
                    I am also interested in cybersecurity! I have started taking
                    online courses in this field and hope to join the cyber
                    battalion in the army soon. :3

                <h2 class="title">Gaming Background</h2>
                <p>
                    I used to play a lot of video games, such as Overwatch and
                    Doom. My peak rank in Overwatch was Diamond 1. Since you are
                    here, I'm going to give you my top three video games of all
                    time:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Doom Eternal</li>
                    <li>Overwatch</li>
                    <li>Ark: Survival Evolved</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 class="title">Text Editor</h2>
                <p>
                    I use several text editors, like Zed, Kate, Sublime Text,
                    VSCodium, and Neovim. I use them all, but I would say my
                    main one is Zed (with Vim motions), followed closely by
                    Neovim. I mainly use the catppuccin mocha theme, and
                    sometimes pine ros√© moon.
